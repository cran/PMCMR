Description: Note, that the 'PMCMR' package is superseded
	     by the novel 'PMCMRplus' package. The PMCMRplus
	     package contains all functions from 
	     'PMCMR' and many more parametric and non-parametric
	     multiple comparison procedures, one-factorial trend
	     tests, as well as improved method functions, 
	     such as print, summary and plot. 
	     The 'PMCMR' package is no longer maintained,
	     but kept for compatibility of reverse depending
	     packages for some time.
