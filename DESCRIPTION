Description: The Kruskal and Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks 
	     or van der Waerden's normal score test can be employed, 
	     if the data do not meet the assumptions 
	     for one-way ANOVA. Provided that significant differences 
	     were detected by the omnibus test, one may be interested 
	     in applying post-hoc tests for pairwise multiple comparisons 
	     (such as Nemenyi's test, Dunn's test, Conover's test,
	     van der Waerden's test). Similarly, one-way ANOVA with repeated 
	     measures that is also referred to as ANOVA with unreplicated 
	     block design can also be conducted via the Friedman-Test 
	     or the Quade-test. The consequent post-hoc pairwise 
	     multiple comparison tests according to Nemenyi, Conover and Quade
	     are also provided in this package. Finally Durbin's test for 
	     a two-way balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) is also given
	     in this package.
