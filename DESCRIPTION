Description: The Kruskal and Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks 
	     can be employed, if the data do not meet the assumptions 
	     for one-way ANOVA. Provided that significant differences 
	     were detected by the Kruskal-Wallis-Test, one may be interested 
	     in applying post-hoc tests for pairwise multiple comparisons 
	     of the ranked data. Similarly, one-way ANOVA with repeated 
	     measures that is also referred to as ANOVA with unreplicated 
	     block design can also be conducted via the Friedman-Test. 
	     The consequent post-hoc pairwise multiple comparison test according 
	     to Nemenyi is also provided in this package.
