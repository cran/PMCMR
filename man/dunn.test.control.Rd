Pairwise Test for Multiple Comparisons of Mean Rank Sums with one

\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
Calculate pairwise multiple comparisons with one control according to Dunn.

\usage{
dunn.test.control (x, g, p.adjust.method = p.adjust.methods, \dots)

\arguments{
  \item{x}{a numeric vector of data values, or a list of numeric data
    vectors.}
  \item{g}{a vector or factor object giving the group for the
    corresponding elements of \code{x}.  Ignored if \code{x} is a
    list.}
  \item{p.adjust.method}{Method for adjusting p values (see \code{\link{p.adjust}}).}
  \item{\dots}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods.}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
For one-factorial designs with samples that do not meet the assumptions
for one-way-ANOVA and subsequent post-hoc tests, the Kruskal-Wallis-Test
\code{\link{kruskal.test}} can be employed that is also referred to as
the Kruskalâ€“Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks. Provided that
significant differences were detected by this global test, one may be
interested in applying post-hoc tests according to Dunn for pairwise
multiple comparisons with one control.

See the vignette for details.

%%  ~~further notes~~
A tie correction will be employed according to Glantz (2012).
As it is the case for multiple testing with one control using
\code{aov}, the user must make sure that the control appears as the first
level in the group vector. There is no formula method enclosed.
